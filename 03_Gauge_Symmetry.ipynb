    "Up until now we always worked with unique eigenvalues. If however we have at least one degeneracy in the eigenvalues of $\\hat{A}$, i.e. different eigenvectors to the same eigenvalue, $\\hat{A}$'s eigenvectors do not automatically diagonalize $\\hat{B}$. Instead, Linear algebra dictates that eigenvectors with degenerate eigenvalues form invariant subspaces with dimensions according to the multiplicity of each eigenvalue. This means that the linear map $U$ consisting of the normalized eigenvectors of $A$ (ordered with respect to their eigenvalue) transforms $B$ into a [block matrix](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Block_matrix) structure.\n",
